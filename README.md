# Battlefield 2042 Gun Master

This is the project site of my Battlefield 2042 Portal "Gun Master" experience, developed for and with the help of the DTN clan.

The experience code is **AAMMMN**.

## About

This Portal experience is based on Battlefield 4's Gun Master mode and tries to mimic it as close as possible. However it solely uses BF2042 weapons.

## FAQ

* **Why can't I use weapon attachments?**  
  All weapon attachments are disabled to ensure a fair game and to increase difficulty.

* **Why can't I select BF2042 specialists?**  
  Some specialists like Casper for example have abilities that can't be disabled via Portal. To ensure a fair game only BF3 characters can be selected.

* **Why do I die so fast? / Why does my health not regenerate?**  
  This is a hardcore setting. Damage is increased and health regeneration disabled.
